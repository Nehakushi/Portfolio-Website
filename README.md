# Portfolio-Website
A sleek, responsive, and modern personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React, if applicable). It showcases my projects, skills, education, and experience in an interactive and user-friendly format. The site includes smooth animations, a downloadable resume, and a contact form with a working mailto feature.
